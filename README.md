#Segmentation Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Crater Detection on Mars

You will find files containing
  * Image preprocessing, Filling missing pixels. New method (PreProcessingImg.ipynb)
  * dividing patches, building the model and Feeding it with filled target images (Model_with_solid.ipynb)
  * Feeding the model with thin target images (edgethin (1).ipynb)
  * Functions to add instance segmentation (InstanceSegFunctions.ipynb) This file contains preprocessing code + Fucntion to add borders to target (generate_border)
