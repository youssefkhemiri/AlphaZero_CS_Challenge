Research Reproducibility of
##Segmentation Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Crater Detection on Mars

You will find files containing
  * Image preprocessing ( Filling missing pixels ) New method
  * dividing patches, building the model and Feeding it with filled target images 
  * Feeding the model with thin target images
  * Functions to add instance segmentation
